Entity Framework Core:
1. Database First Approach : Uses Scaffolding
2. Code First Approach : Uses Migrations

Models Creation:
1. In order to show selected data, models are created which are then mapped to the controllers.

Repositories:
1. For DI to take place, IServices and Services are created.
2. The services should be created to avoid repeating common services each time.
3. These services are called from the Controllers.

Dependency Injection:
1. Transient : Every time a new instance is created.
2. Scoped : The instance is created once for every client request.
3. Singleton : The instance remains same throughout the application.
